# Data-Cube-Computation
Group project as a part of IT494 Big Data Processing (Autumn 2023) DA-IICT

This project attempts to implement the Resilient Distributed Top-Down Computation (RDTDC) and Resilient Distributed Bottom-Up Computation (RDBUC) algorithms as described in the research paper [Scalable distributed data cube computation for large-scale multidimensional data analysis on a Spark cluster](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10586-018-1811-1)
